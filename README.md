Key Technologies Used:
- Arduino Uno: Utilized as the main microcontroller for system control and data processing.
- I2C and LCD: Integrated for displaying real-time student information such as Name, Branch, UID Number, and attendance status ("Present") on the LCD screen.
- RC522 Reader: Employed for RFID card scanning and data retrieval.
- RFID Tags: Assigned to each student for unique identification and attendance tracking.

Functionality Highlights:
1. Card Scanning and Display: Upon scanning an RFID card using the RC522 reader and Arduino Uno, the system instantly displays the student's details on the LCD screen.
2. Real-time Data Storage:*The system seamlessly records attendance data, including student name, branch, UID number, attendance status ("Present"), along with the date and time, storing it in Excel for easy access and analysis With Help of Python Script.
3. C++ Code Implementation: Developed customized C++ code to efficiently manage data processing, card recognition, and LCD interfacing, ensuring smooth system functionality.

Impact and Significance:
- Enhanced Efficiency: Eliminated manual attendance marking, reducing errors and saving administrative time.
- Data-driven Insights: Enabled real-time monitoring of attendance trends and facilitated data-driven decision-making for academic institutions.
- Technological Advancement: Leveraged cutting-edge RFID technology and Arduino programming to create a robust and scalable attendance management solution.

This project not only showcased my technical proficiency in electronics and programming but also demonstrated my ability to innovate and solve real-world challenges using emerging technologies.
